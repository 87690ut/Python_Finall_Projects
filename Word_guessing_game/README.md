📄 Project Name: Ultimate Word Guessing Game (With Categories)
Description:
A smart and interactive Word Guessing Game built in Python that allows users to choose their favorite topic before playing. Unlike simple guessing games, this project features dynamic category selection, intelligent hints, and a robust replay system.
✨ Key Features:
📂 Category Selection: Users can choose from multiple domains like Fruits, Sports, Animals, and Programming Languages.
🧠 Dynamic Data Handling: The program automatically loads the specific word list based on the user's choice using conditional logic.
🔍 Smart Hint System: Provides real-time hints using Python's String Slicing (e.g., showing the first letter) and Character Matching.
🔄 Infinite Replay Loop: Uses a while True master loop to let users switch categories and play endless rounds without restarting the script.
🛡️ Error Handling: Handles case-sensitivity (.lower()) and invalid inputs gracefully.
🛠️ Tech Stack:
Language: Python 3.x
Concepts: Lists, Conditional Statements (If-Elif), Loops (While), Random Module, Input Handling.
🎮 How to Play:
Run the script.
Select a Category (e.g., type sports).
The computer picks a random word from that category.
Start guessing! Use the hints to find the word.
Type resume to pick a new category or exit to quit.
