PYTHON FAKE SENTENCE GENERATOR
------------------------------

1. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BUILD?
We are building a fun project that creates short, fake, and funny sentences using Python. It randomly picks words from different lists to form a unique sentence every time.


2. WHY DID WE BUILD THIS?
We built this just for entertainment purposes and to practice using Python Lists and the Random module.


3. HOW DOES IT WORK?
The program focuses on three main parts to build a sentence:
   - Subject: Who is doing it? (e.g., A cat, My friend)
   - Action: What are they doing? (e.g., is dancing, is eating)
   - Places/Object: Where or with what? (e.g., on the moon, with a spoon)

The program randomly picks one word from each category and joins them together.


4. TECHNICAL CONCEPTS USED
   a. list(): Used to store the collection of random words (Subjects, Actions, Places).

   b. random.choice(): A special command that picks one random word from the list to make the sentence.

   c. print(): To display the final funny result on the screen.

   d. input(): Asks the user if they want to generate another sentence (Yes/No).

   e. while(): A loop that keeps the program running until the user types 'no'.

   f. String Concatenation: The method of joining different words together to form a complete sentence.
